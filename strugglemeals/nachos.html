                    Really simple meal you just take as many chips as you think
                    you can eat,cover them with cheese (I like the mexican style
                    4 chese blend shredded cheese), optional refried beans (go
                    before the cheese) and once they come out I reccomend
                    avocado and a smokey hot sauce (my goto is tabasco
                    chipotle).
