                    An over eazy or over medium egg on toast with cheese. Before
                    I flip the egg i usually cuy the yolk becasue i dont like
                    when my sandwiches are too drippy. The cheese goes on the
                    egg after you flip it and then cover and steam with a little
                    bit of water to melt the cheese. Go for good bread if you
                    can its really worth it,,, Sourdough is prolly the best
                    option in my opinion.
